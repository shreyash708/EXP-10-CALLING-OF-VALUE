Title : Pointer Operations (Call by value and Call by reference)

Tools : VS Code and C++ compiler

Aim:To study and implement Pointer Operations (Call by value and Call by reference)

Theory:

# Call By Value : A copy of value is passed to the function.

-> Changes made inside the function is not reflected on other function.

-> Actual and formal arguments will be created in different memeory location.

# Call By Reference : An address of value is passed to the function.

-> Changes made inside the function is reflected outside the function also.

-> Actual and formal arguments will be created in same memory location.

Conclusion: We learned to apply and the use of call by value and call by reference.
