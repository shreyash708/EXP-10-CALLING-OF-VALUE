# Title : Pointer Operations (Call by value and Call by reference)

# Tools :

VS Code and C++ compiler

# Aim:

To study and implement Pointer Operations (Call by value and Call by reference)

# Theory:

# Call By Value : 

A copy of value is passed to the function.

-> Changes made inside the function is not reflected on other function.

-> Actual and formal arguments will be created in different memeory location.

# Call By Reference : 

An address of value is passed to the function.

-> Changes made inside the function is reflected outside the function also.

-> Actual and formal arguments will be created in same memory location.

# Conclusion: 

In this experiment we learned = Call by Value: The function gets a copy of your data. It's like giving someone a photocopy—your original is safe and cannot be changed by the function.


Call by Reference: The function gets a direct link to your original data. It's like giving someone the original document—any changes they make are permanent. Use this to modify the original variable or for better performance with large data
